                    I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic Product Designer with a strong passion for 3D and AR/VR design. I enjoy combining my artistic background with my technical skills to create innovative and creative solutions.

                    I have experience developing visionary concepts, conducting user research, and establishing product frameworks through the use of animated and interactive prototypes. Possessing a positive attitude and a growth-oriented mindset, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills as a designer.
